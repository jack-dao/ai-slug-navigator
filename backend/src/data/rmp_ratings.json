I feel very very inspired after being in class and talking to him in office hours.\nHe is earnest & goofy & thoughtful & relatable & passionate. He is into experimental avant-garde. The class has some dense readings that are very interesting but slightly grueling. If ur not into art you might find uninteresting",

She goes very fast and her lectures aren't the best, but the explanations on the (paid) ALEKS homework are incredibly useful. Midterm + final make up 60% of your grade. She plays games like Wordle before every lecture. Diligently attend lectures and study hard, and you'll be just fine.",

The concepts are abstract & not entirely explained, but you don't need a perfect understanding to get an A. ~60 pages a week in reading & it's good to keep up cause otherwise the class will make 0 sense. Good for 170b too!",

Professor Silver is really nice and is passionate about his material but the lecture slides are not useful at all, you have to listen to him talk and take notes on that or read the long chapter readings very carefully. It's do-able but it is a drag but he's really nice, just dont like history.",

The lab is worth most of ur grade and is pretty easy since you work in groups through the quarter and can always ask the TA for help with stuff you don't know, they don't grade it harshly as a lot of it is just completion. He also makes it extremely clear whats going to be on the midterm and final.",

He provides you with all the resources you need, and he is very kind with his grading. His lecture problems and office hours are grade-saving. Hope I have him again soon. :) Love ya, Barun!",

For the first miderm, 40-70 was a C, 70 + was a B, did not specify what A was but really? 40% average and you need a 70 to get a B?  Second midterm required 65% to get a B and 90% to get an A with 35% average.  Not bad professor but good luck getting a B or A.",

The class has 2 tests, and 2 papers that make up the entire grade. The tests are not too hard, the midterm was all true/false. The papers also are easy, he gives 5 different prompts to pick from. He also is very understanding. ",

I learned sm Yiddish, & although there's a small packet of homework due before each class, he's reasonable with grading and the hw helps u stay consistent with the language.
