## 📖 Project Overview
**AI Slug Navigator** is a full stack **React** and **Node.js/Express** web application that simplifies course planning for UCSC students, using **Supabase Google OAuth** to let students save and revisit schedules.

It acts as a centralized dashboard that unifies **UCSC course data**, **RateMyProfessors ratings**, and **Google Gemini AI** into a single interface. Instead of juggling multiple tabs to cross reference class times and professor reviews, students can search and filter courses, visualize their weekly schedule, and ask an **AI Academic Advisor** for recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🤖 AI Academic Advisor:** Chat with **Sammy AI** (powered by Gemini 2.5) to find classes based on your interests (for example, “Find me an easy GE for Arts credit”).
* **📅 Smart Schedule Builder:** Add and drop classes with automatic time conflict blocking and unit total calculation.
* **⭐ RMP Integration:** See RateMyProfessors ratings and difficulty scores directly on the course card.
* **⚡ Real Time Search:** Instant search across thousands of courses with best match sorting.
* **🔒 Privacy First:** Uses Google OAuth (Supabase) for secure login. We never sell student data.

## 🤖 How it Works (RAG)
Unlike standard chatbots, this app uses **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** to ground responses in the current course catalog and your in progress schedule.

* **Catalog aware:** Suggestions are based on the latest scraped course data, including availability status when provided.
* **Schedule aware:** It considers the schedule you are building and avoids recommending time conflicts.
* **Prerequisite aware:** It reads prerequisite text and course descriptions to warn about missing requirements.
